# Calculator-using-HTML-CSS

 This is my first project that i do it by myself using web developer tools like CSS, HTML and JS. I try to pick a simple theme that can be upgraded when i become better and understand some more advanced principles of web dev. In the moment this calculator have only the four basics operators: sum, subtract, multiply and division.
